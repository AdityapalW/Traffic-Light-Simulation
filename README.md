# Traffic-Light-Simulation
Traffic Light Simulation using Arduino

## Getting Started

This section will help you set up your workspace and get ready to use Arduino.

### Materials You’ll Need

1. An Arduino board (like the Arduino Uno)
2. A USB cable (usually included with the Arduino board)
3. Your computer
4. Basic electronic components (optional, but helpful for practicing)

### Installing Arduino Software

1. **Download the Arduino IDE**: Go to the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and download the latest version of the Arduino IDE for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
2. **Install the Arduino IDE**: Follow the installation instructions on the Arduino website to install the software on your computer.

> **Note**: The Arduino IDE is the program you’ll use to write, edit, and upload code to your Arduino board.

### Downloading the Project Code

1. Go to our project repository on GitHub and download the code as a ZIP file:
   - Click on the green "Code" button.
   - Select "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer where you can easily find it.

## Using the Code

Now that you have everything ready, you’re going to open and upload the code to your Arduino.

### Connecting Arduino to Your Computer

1. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using the USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE software.

### Uploading Code to Arduino

1. In the Arduino IDE, go to **File > Open** and navigate to the folder where you saved the project files. Open the main `.ino` file.
2. Select your Arduino board model:
   - In the Arduino IDE, go to **Tools > Board** and select your board (for example, "Arduino Uno").
3. Select the correct port for your board:
   - Go to **Tools > Port** and choose the port with your Arduino board. (On Windows, it may show up as COM3 or similar; on Mac, it might look like `/dev/tty.usbmodem...`.)
4. **Upload the Code**:
   - Click the "Upload" button (the right arrow in the toolbar).
   - Wait for the "Done uploading" message at the bottom of the screen. Your code is now running on your Arduino!
